Step 1: General System Overview

Your system will include three main components:

Frontend (Client)

User interface (Web / Desktop / Mobile)

Displays files, allows upload/download/sharing

Sends secure requests to the backend (API)

Backend (Application Server)

Handles business logic: authentication, user management, file metadata, sharing

Communicates with both the database and the storage layer

Storage (File Server / Cloud)

Stores the actual files (S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a local MinIO server)

‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Choosing the Tech Stack

Here‚Äôs an overview of possible technologies:

Component	Language / Frameworks	Pros
Frontend	React (JS/TS), Vue, or Next.js	Modern UI, easy integration with APIs
Backend	Python (FastAPI / Django) or Node.js (Express/Nest.js)	Easy to build APIs, good security libraries
Storage	AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage / MinIO	Simple file storage interface
Database	PostgreSQL / MongoDB	Stores file metadata, user info, and permissions
Authentication	JWT / OAuth2	Industry-standard authentication

If this is a learning project or proof of concept, I recommend:

Backend: Python with FastAPI

Frontend: React

Database: PostgreSQL

Storage: Local folder (with encryption) or MinIO

üîí Step 3: Security Layers (Cyber Focus)

Authentication

Use JWT Tokens or OAuth2

Store passwords securely (bcrypt / Argon2)

Authorization

Access control for files by user or group

Restrict API endpoints by permissions

Encryption

In transit: HTTPS only (TLS 1.3)

At rest: Encrypt stored files (AES-256)

Optional: client-side encryption before upload (great for a cyber project)

Audit & Logging

Track uploads, downloads, login attempts

Store logs securely

Attack Detection

Optional: integrate an IDS (e.g., Snort / Suricata)

Or build logic for anomaly detection in access patterns

All communication is encrypted (HTTPS)

Users authenticate through the backend

The backend manages permissions and file access

üí° Recommended Stack (for Development)
Component	Technology
Frontend	React + TypeScript
Backend	FastAPI (Python)
Database	PostgreSQL
Storage	MinIO
Authentication	JWT
Encryption	AES-256 + HTTPS
Deployment	Docker Compose (for all services)
